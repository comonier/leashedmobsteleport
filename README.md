## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌌 The "Golden Rescue" Teleportation
Never lose a mob again. Our unique **Golden-Rescue** mechanic ensures entities stay bonded to the player during teleports and dimension changes.
*   **Works with:** `/spawn`, `/home`, `/tp` and Portals.
*   **Zero-Loss:** Mobs won't despawn or be left behind, even on high-latency servers.
*   **Mount Persistence:** Stay mounted on your Horse, Camel, or even a Ghast after teleporting!

### 🌈 Dynamic Smart Colors
Our new intelligent messaging system provides visual feedback:
*   **Passive Mobs:** Displayed in <span style="color: #55ff55;">**Light Green**</span>.
*   **Hostile Mobs:** Displayed in <span style="color: #ff5555;">**Light Red**</span>.

### 🛡️ Universal Pacification & Safety
